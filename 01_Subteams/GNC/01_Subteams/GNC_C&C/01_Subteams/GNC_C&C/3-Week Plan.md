# GNC Project Plan

## Objective

Finalize GNC software configurations, validate remaining control systems in simulation, validate servo control architecture, and refine the photogrammetry pipeline for future hardware integration.

---

## Goals Overview

| Goal | Measurables | Deliverables |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Configure & simulate 6-DoF vehicle** | Successful loading of custom 6-DoF frame config into ArduSub/BlueOS; successful execution of control algorithms in SITL | Custom frame configuration file; validated simulation environment; updated control architecture documentation |
| **Validate servo control architecture** | Successful actuation of test servos via BlueOS/MAVLink; minimal latency and precise positional control achieved | Code repository with servo control scripts; test report documenting response times and precision metrics |
| **Refine photogrammetry pipeline** | Continuous processing of RTSP video stream into 3D models with minimal error and dropped frames | Updated Python application code; documentation of RTSP-to-3D pipeline and performance metrics |

## Training Plan

**Custom frame configuration in ArduSub**
- Review ArduSub documentation on creating and compiling custom motor matrices for non-standard frame geometries

**BlueOS & MAVLink fundamentals**
- All new/junior members complete a tutorial on sending basic MAVLink commands via Python to a simulated BlueOS instance

**Photogrammetry pipeline review**
- Async or recorded walkthrough covering the custom Python app structure and the RTSP video ingestion process

---

## Practice Projects

- **Project 1 — Simulation:** Create a basic alternative motor matrix (e.g., simple 4-thruster setup) and load it into SITL to understand the configuration pipeline
- **Project 2 — MAVLink:** Write a Python script to send a basic heartbeat message via MAVLink and read simulated IMU data from the SITL environment
- **Project 3 — Photogrammetry:** Modify the existing photogrammetry app to include error logging if the RTSP stream drops or experiences high latency

---

## Documentation

- **Summer progress tracker** — weekly updates on individual task progress
- **Custom ArduSub config guide** — step-by-step instructions for defining and loading the custom motor matrix into ArduSub
- **Photogrammetry app** — detailed usage instructions and architecture overview: [MATE-ROV-Photogrammetry](https://github.com/akvaithi/MATE-ROV-Photogrammetry)
